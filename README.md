# OM2BFB
OM2BFB a tool for detecting breakage fusion bridge cycles with OGM technology
## About
Breakage Fusion Bridge (BFB) is a chromosomal aberration occurring during cell division where a chromosome breaks and fuses with another resulting in a bridge-like structure. As the cell divides, the bridge stretches and breaks, leading to abnormal configurations when the fragments rejoin. BFB plays a significant role in genomic instability, and its study is crucial for understanding evolution and disease.
OM2BFB is a tool for detecting BFB events using Optical genome mapping technology.
